      <h1>Dev Log and Playtesting</h1>
      <p> As we progressed through our project, our team members worked on different aspects
        of the game every week. Although the general development of our game is explained below through
        the reports, click <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ZQ48maWG8HiEtVX-fBOa6SygjgMwLAiJ4YnWyUaxCSc/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">here</a>
        to view the detailed development log.
      </p><br>
      <p>Most of our playtesting was done by our peers, CSS 385 students. We went through four playtesting
        stages -- Alpha, Beta, Final (part 1), Final (part 2). This section documents our findings from
        each of these stages.

      <section id="alpha">
        <p>For our alpha playtest, we had all the basic mechanics ready. We had worked on the player,
          weapons, health upgrades, map, and all enemies (except the boss). We also included gamepad support
          to make our game more interesting. Below are some of the common observations from our Alpha
          playtest.

      <section id="beta">
        <p>For our Beta playtest, we tried our best to incorporate as much feedback as possible, but
          we could not implement everything that we wanted. That said, we made a lot of changes
          like adding a dodge cooldown, fixing the lighting, changing the background of the map,
          adding tutorials to the game, and nerfing the enemies to make the game beginner friendly.
          We also implemented additional features like the reload mechanic, a main menu, and balanced
          weapon drops. Below are some common observations from our Beta playtest.

        <p>
        <ul>
          <li>Mechanics:</li>
          <ul>

            <li>Enemy quantity needs balancing in the boss room</li>

          <li>Gameplay:</li>
          <ul>
            <li>Tutorials were helpful but it would be great to turn them off when not needed</li>
            <li>Need an objective/ storyline</li>
            <li>Bug fixes with main menu and pause menu</li>

      <section id="final">
        <p>Based on the feedback from beta testers, we had a lot of work to complete. Our final playtesting
          was done in two parts. For part 1 of our playtest, we tried to incorporate all the feedback we were
          given. We implemented the auto reload mechanic, added a map, added damage indicators for
          the characters, added death animations for enemies, added unload optimization systems, fixed menu bugs, and added a storyline and a
          credits scene. Additionally, We implemented other features like dynamic camera control, a new light saber weapon,
          gamepad aim assist, added background music and gun sounds. We also included a settings menu to further support optimization
          through which the players could control features like the resolution, full screen mode, graphics and tutorial controls, and
          sound and music controls. Below is the report of part 1 of our final playtest.

            <ul>
              <li>Helpful map</li>

      <section id="final2">
        <p>For part 2 of our final, we tried to incorporate all the suggestions and polished our game.
          We added features like the boss health bar, a dodge cooldown indicator, boss death animation,
          and death sounds for all enemies. This is the latest release version of our game which we
          also submitted as the final deliverable.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>Most people enjoyed the final release version of our game (<a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1rk3cs3csR2hbpCHnNv_6PdLGnEUQdnPRNAMPi_8zZzY/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">here</a>).
          It was a huge success and we would like to thank all the playtesters who helped us better the game.
          This game would not be the same without your valuable feedback. Thankyou.

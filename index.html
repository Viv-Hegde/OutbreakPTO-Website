      <h1>ABOUT</h1>
      <p>HELP! A group of mutated potatoes have sabotaged and taken over our spaceship. They've
        killed all our crewmates and turned them into zombies. They are now heading to Earth. THEY
        MUST BE STOPPED. You are the only survivor Sargent Amogus. You MUST defeat the Hivemind
        and take back your vessel. It is a rocky road with a lot of enemies to defeat; some are even
        your former crewmates now turned zombies. Do you have what it takes? Can you avenge your crewmates
        and save the Earth? Only one way to find out....

      <p>Outbreak:PTO is the work of <a href="credits.html">four talented individuals</a> for their
      CSS 385 Game Development Class at the University of Washington, Bothell. Our theme for this class
      was "Potatoes." So we came up with a game idea and ran with it. We wanted to have fun while
      creating this game, so we looked at other places for insight. Our game was inspired by Among Us,
      Halo, Starwars, and other bullet hell and roguelike games. We also added our own twist, and
      the result is this game.</p><br>
      <p>Outbreak:PTO is a top-down 2D shooter game. The game takes place in outerspace inside a spaceship
      crawling with potato themed enemies. As the player, you are expected to explore the map, acquire
      weapon and health upgrades, defeat enemies, and challenge the Boss. Either you defeat the boss and win
      the game, or you die trying.
